## Abstract

Let's get one thing straight. This is not a how-to-be-a-millionaire-in-one-week type of book. All this article is, is a summary of values and recommendations, which I observed as being beneficial to my workflow and life in general. It's up to you, if you choose to implement all of the advice or just a portion of it.

Bear in mind, that commandments below are not rules by definition; they are meta-rules, that act as a platform for you to set your own rules. 

## Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Commandments

1. Repetitive tasks must be converted into routines
2. Routines should be improved each iteration
3. Non-routine tasks must be recursively planned ahead
4. Non-routine tasks must be executed as effectively as possible
5. Arguments dictate principle
6. Action must be based on principle
7. Principle should be changed only rarely

### Explanation for programmers

If you have experience with programming, this article can be summarized very quickly. Simply convert points below to real life actions.

* Everything that can be a function, must be a function
* Function should be improved until you are satisfied with time complexity and features
* Assume correct user input, but have exception fallbacks (just in case)
* Static code should be thought through - emphasis on time complexity (include only necessary features)
* Set style conventions, which make sense to you and adhere to them
* Conventions are added incrementally and changed only rarely

### Explanation for normal people

1. ***Repetitive tasks must be converted into routines***

   Most of the things we do are repetitive. Brushing your teeth, going to bed/work/school, buying groceries, eating, showering, tax reports - you get the point. Basically everything you do more than once, is in this sense considered a  repetitive task.

   Routines add predefined steps to those tasks. Steps with the lowest granularity possible. 

   **Why:**

   Routines strip you of interruptions in thinking processes and room for error.

   **Example:**

   Let's take showering as an example. Do you brush your teeth before or after you shower? Is the towel always on the same spot (it should)? Do you start with hot water or cold water first? How exactly do you proceed to shower? Do you step out of the shower with the left or right foot? 

   If the task is a routine, you will have no issue answering all of those questions.

   **How:**

   When you first start to implementing routines, you have to be very aware of what you are doing in the first few iterations. Set the steps while doing the task; concentrate on how you do stuff and if it's effective. Remember the steps for upcoming iterations. Do not back down from set steps. 

   After about 5 iterations, you will realize that you have done the whole task without a single thought interruption. Ergo, you won't give any processing power to the task at hand.  

   

2. ***Routines should be improved each iteration***

   As mentioned above, you should give great importance to the first few iterations. You do not want to implement slow or complex steps in your routines. Break steps into steps, until you are absolutely sure, that everything is perfect. 

   **Why:**

   Satisfaction with routines results in a peace of mind. You might have had a sh*tty day at work, but at least you know, there are things that will always go according to plan.

   **Example:**

   You go to the grocery store every other day and you always forget to buy milk for your morning coffee. Improve your shopping routine by always looking into the fridge/pantry before heading to the store. 

   **How:**

   This is one of the things I am unhappy with. I would like to give you a manual on how to enable your always-look-for-things-to-improve mindset, but I don't have one. You have to learn this by yourself. Try to look for loopholes/errors in everything and you will eventually do it automatically. 

   

3. **Non-routine tasks must be recursively planned ahead**

   Some tasks will not repeat - ever - but you still need to do them efficiently and to specification (requirements from the boss/teacher/parent). There are layers to everyone's life. Family, work/school, personal and other tasks. You will usually combine multiple non-routine tasks and plan them recursively.  

   **Why:**

   Planning every step of a task and then connecting more tasks together will make it much easier to execute. It can also lead to less errors, since you are not splitting the brain power between planning and execution, at the same time.

   **Example:**

   Parents want you to go the store and take out the trash. Seminar work till the day after tomorrow. Boss needs you to read documentation for the next project - till to tomorrow. Friends want you to come play GTA in the afternoon.

   **How:**

   First, sort tasks by due time. Parents, Friends, Work, School. Now estimate how long it will take you to do those tasks - playing time with friends is considered flexible (or *filler task*), but has a start (i.e. you agreed to come at 20:00). Be generous with the timing.

   Parents - 45 min; Friends - circa 2 hours; Work - 3 hours; School - 6 hours. Thing about how you will approach each task. Will you first take the trash out or go to the store? Where exactly do need to go in that store? How long is the document your boss gave you?

   Now cut down the time for each task by about 30%. You will have it back in the next commandment, don't worry.

   Start doing the tasks in order. Since you have already planned all of the steps, all you need to do is execute them. Do them as fast as possible. 

   

4. **Non-routine tasks must be executed as effectively as possible**

     Effectiveness is basically the concept of this whole article. Being effective does not mean half-assing tasks in favor of getting things done quickly. Requirements always come first!

     **Why:**

     Non-routine task are usually assignments or jobs. If you enjoy doing the task, then do as you wish, but if it's mandatory work, which you don't like doing - why waste more time than needed?

     **Example:**

     You have to hand in seminar work next week. It's supposed to be at least 5 pages long. Do you really need those 6 hours? And do you need to be spread out like peanut butter across the whole week?

     **How:**

     Cases like this can make use of *Last Day-* or *Last Minute Effect*. Doing tasks exactly on time or the day before due day, puts stress on you, which in turn results in drive. 

     Some people might say they do a better job, when they have enough time, compared to stress-driven execution of tasks. That can be true to some extend, but it has serious impact on what they can consider, when choosing work field or even what post in that work they can hold.

     Learning to work under stress is beneficial for two kinds of things. First, is doing one-off tasks, for which you did not receive the "needed" time, but still have to be done in time. Secondly, for dealing with stress in general. 

     Stress can be generated by a lot of external forces, which you won't be able to mitigate. You should intentionally put yourself into stressful situations with everyday tasks, so that you can use stress as a driving mechanism, not an inhibitor.

5. **Arguments dictate principle**

   Principles are rules or conventions you set and follow. You have to be able to defend them argumentatively, not only from the external offenders, but mainly the internal offender (yourself). They can not only be bound to tasks, but also to opinions.

   Principles can be divided into two types:

   * Subjective principles
     * Based on prior experience, feeling or inherited from other conventions
     * Arguments will be inherently on the subjective side
     * Usually used on actions/opinions, which do not have an objective answer 
     * I.e. "I always buy socks from xxx company, their quality/price ration is great and they are very comfortable" - that does not mean you hate every other socks manufacturer, but you have decided to stick with the xxx company
     * Or "I always hold the doors for others" - they are able to open the doors themselves, but you have inherited this principle from the conventional man etiquette
   * Logical principles
     * Based purely on logic
     * Arguments must be objective
     * Used on actions/opinions, that can have objective answer
     * Either Kantianism or Utilitarianism will apply
     * I.e. "Effort doesn't count, you do or do not" - Somebody failed to deliver a promise and you don't care that they were *trying*, as *trying* does not yield results
     * Or "I always use bleach to clean the toilet" - You know about the risks of using bleach (you took precautions to mitigate negative impacts on your health), but you also know it's more effective that alcohol based cleaners

   **Why:**

   Doing tasks and actions impulsively yields errors.

   **Example:**

   At any given time, if you are asked "why are you doing this like that?", you should have a concise and well thought out answer. In case of opinions, you answer the "why do you think xxx" question.

   **How:**

   While doing tasks, you will encounter sub-tasks (actions). Think about the possibilities of doing the action and choose the best one. Try to find co-actions ("I always change the cleaning rags, after every other dish cleaning").

6. **Action must be based on principle**

   Actions are sub-tasks - basically every movement or thought.

   **Why:**

   Consistency and peace of mind, since you aware of, and completely agree with, what you are doing.

   **Example:**

   See examples in previous commandments.

   **How:**

   Set the principle on the first encounter. If your principle is genuine, you won't have to remember it. You will most likely be able to recall the same principle 5 years from now.

7. **Principle should be changed only rarely**

   Standing on principle gives you an upper hand, but this can change very quickly, if you say A today and B tomorrow. This can be also cased by lack of sincerity in your thought process. Some people call this stubbornness. Don't take me wrong, there is always a limit to obeying your principles; but if you know that the same people who call you stubborn, are indecisive and contradict themselves often, you should let them know how stupid they sound. 

   **Why:**

   Nobody will respect your opinion or the rest of these commandments, if you change your opinion daily. 

   **Example:**

   One of the few reasons to change your principle is new information, which you did not have at hand when creating the principle and you did not know such information will be available in the future.

   **How:**

   Once you decide to set a principle, change it only if that's the last option.
